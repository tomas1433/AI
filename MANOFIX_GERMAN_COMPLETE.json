    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "Can customers accept my quote directly on the platform?",
      "a1": "YES! All tiers (even Free) can send quotes that customers accept on Manofix. When accepted, it automatically creates a service request and triggers escrow payment. This keeps everything secure and on-platform.",
      "q2": "How many offers can I send per day?",
      "a2": "Free: 1 offer/day | Pro: 5 offers/day | Pro+: 20 offers/day. This helps maintain quality interactions and prevents spam.",
      "q3": "When is my phone number visible to customers?",
      "a3": "Free: Only after successful booking. Pro & Pro+: Always visible on your profile. This helps Pro/Pro+ taskers get more direct inquiries.",
      "q4": "What's the Virtual Visa card?",
      "a4": "Coming soon for Pro and Pro+ users! Spend your Manofix earnings directly with a Visa card. Your idle cash also earns interest while sitting in your account.",
      "q5": "How does the yield-bearing account work?",
      "a5": "Your Manofix balance automatically earns yield (like a savings account). No action needed - your money grows while you work. Pro+ users also get 2% cashback on card spending.",
      "q6": "What are FIX points?",
      "a6": "Points (also called FIX points) are rewards you earn on every completed job. They have real value and can be used on the platform. The FIX Point Ratio determines how many points you earn per euro earned: Free tier has a 1:1 ratio (€100 job = 100 points), Pro tier has a 5:1 ratio (€100 job = 500 points), and Pro+ tier has a 10:1 ratio (€100 job = 1,000 points).",
      "q8": "What happens when a customer accepts my quote?",
      "a8": "1) Quote converts to service request on Manofix. 2) Customer's payment is charged to their card. 3) Funds held in escrow until job complete. 4) You complete the work. 5) Customer marks as done. 6) Money released to your account. All secure and automatic!",
      "q9": "Can I create multiple tasker profiles?",
      "a9": "Yes! There's no limit on the number of tasker profiles you can create. Manage all your services and specialties from one account.",
      "q10": "Do I need to wait for bank transfers?",
      "a10": "Not with the Virtual Visa (Pro/Pro+ coming soon)! Spend earnings instantly. Or continue using traditional payout to your bank account (all tiers)."
